I am an Associate Professor in the School of Transportation at Southeast University. I received my PhD degree in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from the University of New South Wales, and earned a Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from Nanjing Tech University and a Master’s degree in Transportation Engineering from Southeast University. During my PhD, I worked at the CityX Lab at the Research Center for Integrated Transport Innovation. Prior to joining Southeast University, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of New South Wales for two years. My current research centers on complex and future transportation system modeling, simulation, and optimization. <a href="https://tc.seu.edu.cn/2023/1109/c25722a471750/page.htm."> My Chinese website </a> is also available.

For prospective students
======
I am constantly looking for 1-2 Master’s students and 1 PhD student every year who are excited about mathematical modeling and machine learning for smart transportation.
